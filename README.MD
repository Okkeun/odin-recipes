An assignment for The Odin Course. The purpose of this project is to create a basic site with recipes.

For me, this project serves as a reminder of HTML and CSS, as I know the basics. I think that in the future this recipe site will be my training site for CSS experiments, but it's only the plan for now.

In this project I will be using Bootstrap framework compounds, but I'm beginner in Bootstrap so that's why I want to learn more about this technology. I hope that this project will help me master the Bootstrap.
